2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance chip/cpu/spm/x_s3e_dpram/ram_reg_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance chip/cpu/spm/x_s3e_dpram/ram_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance chip/cpu/spm/x_s3e_dpram/ram_reg_2, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance chip/cpu/spm/x_s3e_dpram/ram_reg_3, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>
